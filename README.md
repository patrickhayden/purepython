Leveraging the py-pure-client https://code.purestorage.com/py-pure-client/ this is a collection of scripts for interfacing with Pure Storage FlashArray and Pure1.  Primarily reporting but the snapshot script executes as a POST to the array.  The FlashArray scripts all depend on the existance of a localuser account with an API key.  That key is copied to a local file api.txt which is used to authenticate for script execution.  The Pure1 scripts depend on key exchange described in pure1-key-registration.md  https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png
